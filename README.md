# CS590-DeepLearners
CS590 Deep Learning Course Project

This repo contains all the SOTA implementations along with proposed architecture.
The proposed model is implemented in the DLDM.ipynb file. The Model architecture and parameter details are store in the DLDM_model_architecture.txt and DLDM_Model_Parameters.jpeg files.
To run the code, run the DLDM.ipynb file on google colab.
